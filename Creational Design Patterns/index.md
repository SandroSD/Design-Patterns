# Creational Design Patterns
Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- <b>Factory Method:</b> Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- <b>Abstract Factory:</b> Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- <b>Builder:</b> Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
- <b>Prototype:</b> Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
- <b>Singleton:</b> Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
