# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly ocurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a design problem in your code.

The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concepto for solving a particular problem.

## What does the pattern consist of?

- <b>Intent</b> of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- <b>Motivation</b> further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- <b>Structure</b> of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
